1) Cleanup sizing() javascript function all html page
    - Should probably split it out into a shared javascript file
2) Investigate consolidating the nav bar and header sections of each html file
so we don't need to keep multiple copies of that code
3) Some sort of templating would be nice for the rows in educationCourses.html  
    - Is vanilla html capable of this on its own?
4) Having a common header would be helpful. Wouldn't have to repeat things like the title
