										<p>This was the first application built as part of the "CPSC 453 - Introduction

											Computer Graphics" Course. We needed
											to create four scenes and generate the geometry for a new fractal shape in
											each
											scene. Keyboard inputs were used to
											switch between scenes as well as change the number of iterations drawn for
											each
											scene.
										</p><br />
										<p>The four fractal shapes we needed to generate for this assignment were: </p>
										<ol>
											<li>Serpinsky Triangle</li>
											<li>A Diamonds and Squares Pattern</li>
											<li>The Koch Snowflake</li>

										<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
										<p>This application was built as the term project for the ENSF 409 - Principles
											of
											Software Development course at the University of Calgary. The instructor of
											the
											course introduced this project first as a part a weekly lab assignment. The
											course focused heavily on object oriented design, and used Java as the
											language
											of instruction.</p>
										<p>The first step in the lab assignment was to analyze the project's problem
											statement and create a UML class diagram. The second step was use this class
											diagram to create a simple console based application. Text files were
											provided
											as inital data input into the application, and the user was presented with a
											menu from the command-line/console to add, delete, and edit information
											related
											to tools in the inventory of a toolshop.</p>
										<p>Weeks later, the work for this lab assignment was brought back for the
											course's
											final project. The goal of the final project was to transform this simple
											one
											machine console based application into a Client-Server application. Lots of
											emphasis was placed proper system design and another set of class diagrams
											was
											created. The instruction was to build this application using the
											Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. A simple graphical user
											interface
											was built for the client, and a mySQL database replaced text files on the
											server-side. The client and server programs communicated through socket
											programming, and the server was required to use a thread pool to handle
											concurrency and multiple clients at the same time.</p><br />

										<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>
										<p>
											From a learning standpoint, this was a very involved project. It helped in
											me to
											develop an understanding of client-server architecture, the MVC design
											pattern,
											multithreading and socket programming. At the time this was the largest
											project
											I had worked on, and I think this project was the first to give me a sense
											of
											how much planning and design work goes into creating quality software.

										<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
										<p>This project was my first "real" project and came at the end of the first
											programming class I ever took, ENGG 233 - Computing for Engineers. The
											course
											was an introductory programming course, taught using a language called
											Processing, and this was the final project for the course.</p>
										<p>The objective of the project was to create a simple game that simulated
											billiards/pool. The game was only single player and did not involve any
											rules
											except that if you sunk the white ball the game was over. The player
											controlled
											their que stick with the mouse and adjusted the power of their shot with the
											up
											and down arrow keys. Addition features such as a timer and sound effects
											allowed
											students to gain bonus points on the grading of the assignment.</p><br />

										<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>
										<p>This project was given to the class just after we had covered classes and
											objects
											in the lectures. It was my first experience building a system with these
											concepts. I remember that on my first attempt at this project nothing was
											working, so I completely stoped my work and began again completely from
											scratch.
										</p>
										<p>On the second attempt I restuctured my classes and everything went super
											smoothly. The main lesson I took away from this was the lesson that how a
											program is structured does matter and doing things correctly at the
											beginning
											will make things a lot easier at the end.</p>
