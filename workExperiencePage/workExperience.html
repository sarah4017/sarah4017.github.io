											My skills with git also improved working here, and I gained a lot of
											technical
											knowledge about object oriented

							<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
							<p>The goal of this project was to build an application to allow clients in group
								counselling
								programs to complete assessment questionnaires each week throughout a 10-14 week program
								duration. The application was web-based and was presented to clients via tablets
								connected
								to the Calgary Counselling Centre's internal network. This project was completed by
								myself
								and another summer student using C# and the .NET framework.</p>

							<p>The Calgary Counselling Centre runs 12 different group programs for clients with
								different
								needs. Some of the programs are for adults, while others are intended for children. Each
								group has a "Pre-Package" which is completed at the first session, a "Post-Package"
								which
								was completed at the final session, and a standard package that is completed at every
								session in between. Each package consists of a variable number of individual
								questionnaires.
								The application needed to be able to get the client's log-in information, determine
								which
								questionnaire package the client was to complete that day, then serve that package to
								the
								client. The client's questionnaire answer data was then stored in a database before
								being
								pulled out and processed by a software used by counsellors and the centre's Research
								department. In total, there were about 40 individual questionnaires arranged into
								approximately 30 packages.</p><br />
							<h4><u>Project Add-ons</u></h4>
							<p>In addition to the main project requirements, my partner and I had and implemented some
								ideas
								to make the project more complete. The first was an editing interface that allowed users
								to
								modify the contents of programs, packages, sections and questions. This functioned
								through a
								web API. The second add-on was an automated emailing system. This system detected common
								database configuration errors and sent an appropriate email to the Centre's IT
								Coordinator
								in response. The system was also capable of sending summary reports of important
								questions,
								but this feature was turned off. Finally, simple interface was built with another web
								API to
								allow retrieve client entered question data. The interface allowed the user to specify
								filters such as date, program type, package type, client, etc. On the client-side, the
								retrieved data was formatted into an excel spreadsheet that could be downloaded and
								inputted
								into the software used by the Research Department.</p>

							<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>
							<p>As my first industry experience, I learned that being flexible throughout the development
								process is very important as requirements can change and be added at any moment. I also
								learned a lot about teamwork in software development. My partner and I worked very well
								together during this project; often one of his ideas would spark an idea in me which
								would
								then spark an idea in him and allow us to find the best solution to whatever problem we
								were
								facing. I learned that when designing a system it is important to design for the future
								as
								well as for the present moment...and I also learned a little bit about the .NET
								framework,
								C#, SQL, databases, HTML, javascript and CSS.</p>
