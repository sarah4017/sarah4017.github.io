								<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>A running watch.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One morning I woke up and started thinking about logging my training and how I had lost touch with that habbit. Previously, I had logged 
										training data with pen and paper. This took a few minutes each day and, over time, became harder and harder to look through. With years of 
										data spread over different physical log books, I wished that I had one of the new fancy watches that can automatically upload run 
										data to your phone and into applications like Strava or Garmin Connect where you could analyze it easily.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I was also looking for a new side project at the time and decided it would be more fun to try and build my own GPS running watch 
										then go buy a watch similar to the watches all of my running friends have. I thought this project would be a good opportunity to learn more about some of 
										the real world problems faced by embedded systems and wearable electronics.
									</p>
									<p>This project idea was the main motivation 
										behind the GregBuild project. I needed a build system for writing embedded C code to go on the microcontroller in the watch. 
										As has become the theme of my recent side projects, I decided to write my own build system (for learning and to tailor it to 
										my own specific needs and wants). So I created
										GregBuild.
										After about four months of getting GregBuild to a level that was sufficient and convenient enough that I thought I could use it for a real project
										I began working on the GregWatch project. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Progess to this date has only included getting some simple graphic displays on the watch screen,
										but it has also revealed a few bugs in GregBuild and is a good opportunity to gain knowledge about that project as I work on this one. 
										Eventually, I think that I could also tie this project into the DinosInspire training log project from a few years back. I think there is a lot of work 
										to be done before I start to work on that, but it would be an interesting bringing together of a bunch of different projects to create a full product similar to how companies
										like Garmin building everything from the watch, up to the web user face and all of the data analysis of what is collected from physical device.

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>	
									<p>
										In addition to the code, I will need to learn a lot of other things
										about creating a customer ready electronic product (I'm not trying to sell this to an actual customer, but for the sake of learning I want to 
										take it to the level of quality where I could). What I imagine I will need to learn includes:
									</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>How to solder</li>
										<li>How to 3D print/manufacture a case for the watch</li>
										<li>How to shrink the system down from a microcontroller on an Arduino board and a bunch of stuff on a breadboard, 
											down into somehting that can fit on a person's wrist
										</li>
										<li>Shrinking it down might require a customer PCB, I will need to learn how to create that</li>
										<li>In general I will probably need to learn a lot about electronics and more of the hardware side of the project</li>
										<li>To run the screen I have already reviewed/re-learned some of the material on the SPI interface that I had learned in school (ENCM 511 - Embedded Systems Interfacing)</li>
										<li>When I get to the point of using buttons and a GPS module, I will need to learn more about both the hardware and software interfaces
											required with those aspects of the project.
										</li>
										<li>How to generate more advanced graphics for the screen. An idea for something to do here is to re-learn some 
											of the image/video processing techniques I learned in ENEL 503 - Computer Vision to take any image or video,
											resize it and convert it to monochrome, then use the result to display the original imagine on my small monochrome watch screen display.
										</li>

								<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>A build system for C/C++ projects that allows the user to build for either 
                                        the host machine and or a different target hardware. For example, using their x86 laptop,
                                        a user could build an executable for that same x86 laptop. Or for the case of building 
                                        for a different target hardware, the user could use GregBuild on their x86 laptop to build
                                        an exectuable to run on a different harware, such as a microcontroller.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        GregBuild is a project that I see myself working on for a long time. There is a lot that 
                                        goes into a professional grade build system, and this project is not there yet.
                                        I worked on this for about four months before making the 0.0.1 release. After those four months
                                        it was working well enough that I decided to stop actively developing it and start using it as a
                                        user.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are a lot of things I would still like to improve. So another 4 months of 
                                        working on GregBuild may be in the cards for the not so distant future.

                                        completed each step they would click the "Next Step" button and progress through the set of steps that 
                                        made up a routine.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The teacher's could make unique routines and assign those routines to students. The application also had a 
                                        page called the "Live Feed" that was a real time tracker of the students' progress through their routines.
                                        We thought this could be useful for teacher's to see where the students where in a routine if the teacher
                                        was working with the student over the phone or through zoom/skype at the same time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The last feature that this routines manager app had was that it would record how long it took the student
                                        to complete each step and each routine. Collecting this data would help monitoring learning and progress
                                        of the student completing their routines. We thought this would be useful data for the teacher's 
                                        and occupational therapists to have while working with the special education students.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This project reached a few teachers who made accounts for their classrooms.
                                    </p>

									<p>
										This project was completed using the Java Spring framework and VueJS. I had used these tools previously
                                        with the Helping Hands Caf&eacute Systems application that was never released, but this was my first project
                                        using these tools that actually reached a customer. In addition to learning these tools, I had my first experience
                                        using Amazon Web Services. I learned how to setup an EC2 instance, an RDS database, and an ELB load balancer. 
                                        I learned a little bit about SSL certificates, and deployed my first web application using HTTPS.

								<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>Helping Hands Caf&eacute Systems was a project with the goal to improve the efficiency of student run caf&eacute programs in schools. More specifically, it was aimed at caf&eacute programs where the students are enrolled in the school's special education program and the caf&eacute organizers are occuptional therapists.  </p>
									<p>The inspiration for Helping Hands came from a University of Calgary track teammate, Jan Erik Naess. Jan Erik discovered this problem through the school where his mom was working and came to me in the fall of 2019 asking me to help him develop a solution. The only technology the program had in place at the time was a Google Form that allowed customers to place orders. Once orders were placed occuptional therapists would print of large summaries and then filter go through all of the orders and data manually. This was very hard and time consuming. To help this I developed a web application and an automatic label printing solution. </p>
									<p>In January 2020, we got our system set up at Hinsdale South High School in Darien, Illinois. We were hoping to expand to some of the nearby schools, but ended up stopping on the project when COVID-19 started.</p>
									<p>In addition to the new technology, we have made a few posters for the students and teachers of the caf&eacute to put up around the school. </p>
									<p>The solution we implemented was created was a simple google scripts app. We used this technology to start because it was able to easily interface with 
                                        the pre-existing Google form that the caf&eacute was using. Before we finished working on this project, I started to create a
                                        more invloved application using the Java Spring framework and VueJs. That application had customer accounts, an improved order form, and a performance measurement system to track how 
                                        the students were progressing with their skills in the caf&eacute. We hoped that recording data on how long it took
                                        students to make orders would be beneficial to the occupation therapists working with them and could even perhaps 
                                        be used on a resume for the students to apply to jobs at caf&eacutes outside of the school. However, when COVID-19 started
                                        we switched to working on Helping Hands Routines and the Java Spring/VueJS caf&eacute application never made it to the school. 
                                    </p>

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>	
									<p>
										I learned a bit about Google's developer products, Windows batch scripting, and Brother label printers.
									</p>
									<p>Google has a cloud print service. However, we had formatting issues when using this to send print jobs to the label printer. So the solution to automate printing was to use batch scripting and some python to download data from a Google drive, open printing software, and print orders with a preformatted template. This was done with a Windows laptop as the 'print server'. During this process, I learned that Brother's QL series label printer support the use of raster and ESC-P commands. Although never implemented, an idea for later improvements was to send raw binary data directly from our application to the printer without needing to open the Brother QL printer software on a desktop computer. We were also considering the switch to using a small raspberry pi device as a print server instead of a Windows laptop.</p>

								<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>This was a weekend warrior type project that I worked on during the summer of 2017. This project was a web-based application, built using PHP, that allowed distance runners to create accounts and then store data related to their training in a database. The inspiration for this project came from my involvment in the sport and awareness of the importance of keeping a proper training log. I viewed the project as an opportunity to learn about the technology and get a sense for how other training log websites, like Garmin Connect or Strava, might work.</p>
									<p>This project did not reach completion by the end of summer 2017 and got put on the backburner when school begin in September. However, I did feel that I took this project far enough to achieve the goal of learning the basics of how client-side and server side languages work together in a web application to navigate from page to page, pass data, and interact with a database.</p><br />

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>	
									<p>Looking back at this project it is interesting to see how many things I could have done better, and how much I have learned since then. From a user experience point of view, the two main area for improvement are mobile responsiveness and dynamic display of formatted run/workout data. These are areas that I feel I have greatly improved upon with the my work at the Calgary Counselling Centre and with this personal portfolio website. If I were to do the training log project again a lot of things would be different, but overall I think it was a good learning experience.</p>

								<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>This was another project for fun in the summer of 2017.  The idea for the project came from a youtube video. The video was about 20 minutes long and showed how to use the Twilio API to send an SMS message with python.</p>
									<p>To expand on what was shown in the video, I decided to add a password system that identified the user an sent the message to a different phone number based on the user. I also decided to add a user interface. To do this I used the Tkinter python library, and this was my first introduction to graphical user interfaces. This little app also added to the ideas presented in the video by using ngrok webhooks to allow for the phone that recieved the initial message to send a response back to the computer.</p><br/>

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>	
									<p>The main take aways from this project were learning about APIs, webhooks, and graphical user interfaces. This project introduced me to the idea of sending requests from one machine to another, and seeing how this can be triggered by event based programming.</p>
