									<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>A running watch.
									</p>
									<p>
										One morning I woke up and started thinking about logging my training and how I
										had lost touch with that habbit. Previously, I had logged
										training data with pen and paper. This took a few minutes each day and, over
										time, became harder and harder to look through. With years of
										data spread over different physical log books, I wished that I had one of the
										new fancy watches that can automatically upload run
										data to your phone and into applications like Strava or Garmin Connect where you
										could analyze it easily.
									</p>
									<p>
										I was also looking for a new side project at the time and decided it would be
										more fun to try and build my own GPS running watch
										then go buy a watch similar to the watches all of my running friends have. I
										thought this project would be a good opportunity to learn more about some of
										the real world problems faced by embedded systems and wearable electronics.
									</p>
									<p>This project idea was the main motivation
										behind the GregBuild project. I needed a build system for writing embedded C
										code to go on the microcontroller in the watch.
										As has become the theme of my recent side projects, I decided to write my own
										build system (for learning and to tailor it to
										my own specific needs and wants). So I created
										GregBuild.
										After about four months of getting GregBuild to a level that was sufficient and
										convenient enough that I thought I could use it for a real project
										I began working on the GregWatch project.
									</p>
									<p>
										Progess to this date has only included getting some simple graphic displays on
										the watch screen,
										but it has also revealed a few bugs in GregBuild and is a good opportunity to
										gain knowledge about that project as I work on this one.
										Eventually, I think that I could also tie this project into the DinosInspire
										training log project from a few years back. I think there is a lot of work
										to be done before I start to work on that, but it would be an interesting
										bringing together of a bunch of different projects to create a full product
										similar to how companies
										like Garmin building everything from the watch, up to the web user face and all
										of the data analysis of what is collected from physical device.

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>
									<p>
										In addition to the code, I will need to learn a lot of other things
										about creating a customer ready electronic product (I'm not trying to sell this
										to an actual customer, but for the sake of learning I want to
										take it to the level of quality where I could). What I imagine I will need to
										learn includes:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>How to solder</li>
										<li>How to 3D print/manufacture a case for the watch</li>
										<li>How to shrink the system down from a microcontroller on an Arduino board and
											a bunch of stuff on a breadboard,
											down into somehting that can fit on a person's wrist
										</li>
										<li>Shrinking it down might require a customer PCB, I will need to learn how to
											create that</li>
										<li>In general I will probably need to learn a lot about electronics and more of
											the hardware side of the project</li>
										<li>To run the screen I have already reviewed/re-learned some of the material on
											the SPI interface that I had learned in school (ENCM 511 - Embedded Systems
											Interfacing)</li>
										<li>When I get to the point of using buttons and a GPS module, I will need to
											learn more about both the hardware and software interfaces
											required with those aspects of the project.
										</li>
										<li>How to generate more advanced graphics for the screen. An idea for something
											to do here is to re-learn some
											of the image/video processing techniques I learned in ENEL 503 - Computer
											Vision to take any image or video,
											resize it and convert it to monochrome, then use the result to display the
											original imagine on my small monochrome watch screen display.
										</li>

									<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>This project came out of the "Helping Hands Caf&eacute Systems" project below.
										Myself and a partner
										were working together to help special education teacher's organize a student run
										caf&eacute at a high school
										in Illinois where his family lived. He managed the organization/communication
										with the school and I managed
										the technical side of things.
									</p>
									<p>When COVID-19 began and schools were shut down for a while, we stopped working on
										the caf&eacute idea
										and began working on a new idea to help the teachers while students were at
										home. The idea was to have
										a web application that managed a set of "routines" for each student to complete
										at home. After the student
										completed each step they would click the "Next Step" button and progress through
										the set of steps that
										made up a routine.
									</p>
									<p>The teacher's could make unique routines and assign those routines to students.
										The application also had a
										page called the "Live Feed" that was a real time tracker of the students'
										progress through their routines.
										We thought this could be useful for teacher's to see where the students where in
										a routine if the teacher
										was working with the student over the phone or through zoom/skype at the same
										time.
									</p>
									<p>The last feature that this routines manager app had was that it would record how
										long it took the student
										to complete each step and each routine. Collecting this data would help
										monitoring learning and progress
										of the student completing their routines. We thought this would be useful data
										for the teacher's
										and occupational therapists to have while working with the special education
										students.
									</p>
									<p>
										This project reached a few teachers who made accounts for their classrooms.

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>
									<p>
										This project was completed using the Java Spring framework and VueJS. I had used
										these tools previously
										with the Helping Hands Caf&eacute Systems application that was never released,
										but this was my first project
										using these tools that actually reached a customer. In addition to learning
										these tools, I had my first experience
										using Amazon Web Services. I learned how to setup an EC2 instance, an RDS
										database, and an ELB load balancer.
										I learned a little bit about SSL certificates, and deployed my first web
										application using HTTPS.

									<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>Helping Hands Caf&eacute Systems was a project with the goal to improve the
										efficiency of student run caf&eacute programs in schools. More specifically, it
										was aimed at caf&eacute programs where the students are enrolled in the school's
										special education program and the caf&eacute organizers are occuptional
										therapists. </p>
									<p>The inspiration for Helping Hands came from a University of Calgary track
										teammate, Jan Erik Naess. Jan Erik discovered this problem through the school
										where his mom was working and came to me in the fall of 2019 asking me to help
										him develop a solution. The only technology the program had in place at the time
										was a Google Form that allowed customers to place orders. Once orders were
										placed occuptional therapists would print of large summaries and then filter go
										through all of the orders and data manually. This was very hard and time
										consuming. To help this I developed a web application and an automatic label
										printing solution. </p>
									<p>In January 2020, we got our system set up at Hinsdale South High School in
										Darien, Illinois. We were hoping to expand to some of the nearby schools, but
										ended up stopping on the project when COVID-19 started.</p>
									<p>In addition to the new technology, we have made a few posters for the students
										and teachers of the caf&eacute to put up around the school. </p>
									<p>The solution we implemented was created was a simple google scripts app. We used
										this technology to start because it was able to easily interface with
										the pre-existing Google form that the caf&eacute was using. Before we finished
										working on this project, I started to create a
										more invloved application using the Java Spring framework and VueJs. That
										application had customer accounts, an improved order form, and a performance
										measurement system to track how
										the students were progressing with their skills in the caf&eacute. We hoped that
										recording data on how long it took
										students to make orders would be beneficial to the occupation therapists working
										with them and could even perhaps
										be used on a resume for the students to apply to jobs at caf&eacutes outside of
										the school. However, when COVID-19 started
										we switched to working on Helping Hands Routines and the Java Spring/VueJS
										caf&eacute application never made it to the school.

									<br />
									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>
									<p>
										I learned a bit about Google's developer products, Windows batch scripting, and
										Brother label printers.
									</p>
									<p>Google has a cloud print service. However, we had formatting issues when using
										this to send print jobs to the label printer. So the solution to automate
										printing was to use batch scripting and some python to download data from a
										Google drive, open printing software, and print orders with a preformatted
										template. This was done with a Windows laptop as the 'print server'. During this
										process, I learned that Brother's QL series label printer support the use of
										raster and ESC-P commands. Although never implemented, an idea for later
										improvements was to send raw binary data directly from our application to the
										printer without needing to open the Brother QL printer software on a desktop
										computer. We were also considering the switch to using a small raspberry pi
										device as a print server instead of a Windows laptop.</p>

										training in a database. The inspiration for this project came from my involvment
										in the sport and awareness of the importance of keeping a proper training log. I
										viewed the project as an opportunity to learn about the technology and get a
										sense for how other training log websites, like Garmin Connect or Strava, might
										work.</p>
									<p>This project did not reach completion by the end of summer 2017 and got put on
										the backburner when school begin in September. However, I did feel that I took
										this project far enough to achieve the goal of learning the basics of how
										client-side and server side languages work together in a web application to
										navigate from page to page, pass data, and interact with a database.</p><br />

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>
									<p>Looking back at this project it is interesting to see how many things I could
										have done better, and how much I have learned since then. From a user experience
										point of view, the two main area for improvement are mobile responsiveness and
										dynamic display of formatted run/workout data. These are areas that I feel I
										have greatly improved upon with the my work at the Calgary Counselling Centre
										and with this personal portfolio website. If I were to do the training log
										project again a lot of things would be different, but overall I think it was a
										good learning experience.</p>

									<h4><u>Project Description</u></h4>
									<p>This was another project for fun in the summer of 2017. The idea for the project
										came from a youtube video. The video was about 20 minutes long and showed how to
										use the Twilio API to send an SMS message with python.</p>
									<p>To expand on what was shown in the video, I decided to add a password system that
										identified the user an sent the message to a different phone number based on the
										user. I also decided to add a user interface. To do this I used the Tkinter
										python library, and this was my first introduction to graphical user interfaces.
										This little app also added to the ideas presented in the video by using ngrok
										webhooks to allow for the phone that recieved the initial message to send a
										response back to the computer.</p><br />

									<h4><u>Lessons Learned</u></h4>
									<p>The main take aways from this project were learning about APIs, webhooks, and
										graphical user interfaces. This project introduced me to the idea of sending
										requests from one machine to another, and seeing how this can be triggered by
										event based programming.</p>
